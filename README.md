The main home of the Quaver AGN TESS reduction pipeline

Quaver is an interactive, tunable pipeline designed to handle TESS data of stochastically varying sources, especially AGN. 

Quaver allows you to interactively choose your extraction aperture, and to click-mask troublesome cadences. You can also choose
from three levels of sophistication for your systematics correction, and tune the parameters for each one. 

For further information on the workflow, software dependencies, and to see examples, check out the Quaver Users Guide PDF in this folder.
